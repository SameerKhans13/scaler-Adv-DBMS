# Advanced Database Management Systems (Advanced DBMS)

# Capstone Project — MiniDB Final System Guidelines

## Overview

The Capstone Project is the most important component of the Advanced DBMS course.

Throughout the course, students build individual database components including storage engines, indexing structures, query processing, transaction management, concurrency control, and recovery mechanisms. The capstone project brings all of these components together into a coherent, working relational database system.

The goal is to design, implement, and demonstrate a functioning MiniDB system that incorporates the concepts studied across all lab modules.

Unlike traditional assignments, this project evaluates system integration, architectural understanding, engineering trade-offs, and the ability to explain design decisions.

Students will work in teams and submit their project through GitHub along with documentation and a project demonstration.

# Project Objective

The objective is NOT to:

- Build a feature-rich database with hundreds of commands.
- Copy existing open-source database implementations.
- Generate code without understanding the underlying concepts.
- Optimize for lines of code rather than correctness and design.

You are expected to:

- Build a working database engine from foundational components.
- Integrate storage, indexing, query processing, transactions, and recovery.
- Demonstrate understanding of database internals.
- Make sound engineering decisions and explain trade-offs.
- Deliver a functioning system that can be evaluated through demonstrations and discussion.

Marks will primarily be awarded based on:

- Correctness
- Completeness
- System design
- Engineering quality
- Understanding demonstrated during the viva

# Purpose of the Viva

The viva is intended as a sanity check to ensure that:

- Students understand the code they submit.
- Students understand the architecture they implemented.
- Students can explain key database concepts used in their system.
- The project is functional and genuinely developed by the team.

This is not intended to be a difficult theoretical examination.

However, students should be prepared to explain:

- Their implementation choices
- Major modules
- Trade-offs
- Benchmark results
- Demonstrated functionality

# Final Reminder

Building a database system is one of the most challenging and rewarding systems projects in computer science.

The objective of this capstone is not merely to produce code, but to demonstrate an understanding of how real databases are engineered.

Focus on:

- Correctness
- Simplicity
- Architectural clarity
- Trade-off analysis
- Engineering rigor

A well-designed and thoroughly understood MiniDB is significantly more valuable than a larger system whose implementation cannot be explained or defended during the project discussion.
